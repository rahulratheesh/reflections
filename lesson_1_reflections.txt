Though I knew diff before, I didn't know how the + and - symbols worked. 
After watching the video I am clear on those concepts.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could easily take an earlier version and customize a different flavour of it for a different need!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros:
Commits done as needed for the user
Cons:
User might forget to create a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The files can be related to the same logic, hence tracking them together helps.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat
git diff <commit_id_1> <commit_id_2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Enough of this! I am not going to answer.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Wow! My command prompt is looking great.
Thanks for that.
